Build a gift registry mobile web app, which allows a group of people to purchase a product for a recipient.

It should have the following features:
- A primary "group lead" is the person who will actually make the purchase on behalf of the group
- Group lead user gives their first name, last name and email address
- Additional group members can be added/invited to join the group
- Products are rendered for browsing and should have filtering and search capabilities based on what the Shopify catalog API supports today
- Products eligible for the gifting registry are sourced exclusively from Shopify's catalog API
- A recipient will be designated whose address the gift will be shipped to, however the email address used for the transaction should use an email relay, so that the recipient never receives any transactional emails associated with the purchases.
